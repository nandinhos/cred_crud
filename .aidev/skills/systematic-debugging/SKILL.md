# Systematic Debugging Skill

## When to Use
When encountering bugs, errors, or unexpected behavior.

## The 4 Phases

### Phase 1: REPRODUCE
Make the bug happen reliably.

1. **Minimal Reproduction**
   - Simplest steps to trigger
   - Isolate from other factors
   - Document exact steps

2. **Capture Evidence**
   - Error messages
   - Stack traces
   - Logs
   - Screenshots/videos

3. **Create Failing Test**
   - Write test that exposes bug
   - Test MUST fail currently
   - Test will validate fix

### Phase 2: ISOLATE
Find where the bug originates.

1. **Binary Search**
   - Divide code in half
   - Check which half has bug
   - Repeat until found

2. **Add Logging**
   - Strategic console.log/var_dump
   - Track data flow
   - Identify transformation point

3. **Check Assumptions**
   - Validate inputs
   - Verify state
   - Confirm expectations

### Phase 3: ROOT CAUSE
Understand WHY it's happening.

1. **Trace Backwards**
   - From symptom to cause
   - Follow data flow
   - Check each transformation

2. **Ask "Why?" 5 Times**
   - Surface issue: "Form doesn't submit"
   - Why? "Validation fails"
   - Why? "Field value is null"
   - Why? "Not bound correctly"
   - Why? "Missing wire:model"
   - Root cause found!

3. **Document Understanding**
   - What is happening
   - What should happen
   - What causes the difference

### Phase 4: FIX & PREVENT
Fix the bug and prevent recurrence.

1. **Verify Test Fails**
   - Run the failing test
   - Confirm it fails for right reason

2. **Implement Fix**
   - Minimal change to fix
   - Don't refactor while fixing

3. **Verify Test Passes**
   - Run test again
   - Confirm it passes

4. **Run Full Suite**
   - No regressions
   - All tests pass

5. **Document Lesson** (RECOMENDADO)
   - Ative a skill `learned-lesson` para salvar este conhecimento permanentemente.
   - Salve localmente em `.aidev/memory/kb/`.
   - Salve globalmente via `basic-memory` MCP se for uma solução genérica.
